Encapsulation
A: security of the data by hiding the implementation, variables
D: extra run-time to call the set/get method, the compiler doesnt enforce it 

Inheritance
A: reuse the functionality, readability of the code
D: extra run-time for the program to determine the levels of overload classes, classes are coupled

Abstract
A: organize programs, create functionality that subclasses can implement or override
D: enforce inheritance

Polymorphism
A: reuse code, maintainability, extensibility, reduction in complexity
D: difficult to implement, extra run-time
